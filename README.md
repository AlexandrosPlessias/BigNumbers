Addition &amp; Subtraction for Big Numbers

First, we ask the user which function he wants to apply after selecting a function of his program, we ask him to enter the 2 numbers he wants. It is worth noting that the user has the ability to put a sign before the number if he does not put, the sign '+ + is automatically entered. The number is dynamically entered one by one (use getchar) and stored in the corresponding node of the number list. The list we use is very similar to stack, which is why the document was selected in the "List Selection" section.

Then, depending on the user's choice, we apply the function of addition or subtraction by calling the addFunction or subFunction functions whose explanation exists in the sections "addFunction" and "subFunction".

Finally, after the operation is performed, the result is displayed on the screen and the user is given the opportunity to terminate or continue the program.
